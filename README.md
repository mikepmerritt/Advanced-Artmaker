## Features

## About Artmaker

The original artmaker was made at a cybersecurity-focused internship as a Python script during an attempt of hiding or removing an encoded message contained in an image using steganography. It was supposed to rotate the image and hide the encoded values by blending the colors (the messsage was being stored by changing the color values), but it didn't quite work properly, resulting in the blurry images that looked like an abstract representation of the original. Since the images looked interesting, I saved the script as artmaker, but quickly went back to trying to solve the original issue. Years later, I decided to come back to artmaker to update the script to be more useful and robust.
